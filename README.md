## 💡 Project Statement

This Weather Application project demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of API integration with a creative user interface. The development process followed these phases:

1. **API Research** – Explored the OpenWeather API documentation to understand endpoints and data structure  
2. **UI Design** – Created a retro newspaper layout for displaying weather data  
3. **HTML/CSS Development** – Built structure and responsive styling by hand  
4. **JavaScript Integration** – Used `fetch()` to retrieve weather data and display it in real time  
5. **Feature Enhancements** – Included geolocation, animated loading states, error handling, and ASCII-style graphs
